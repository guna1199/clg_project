SMT is process used for developing PCBs, which are the boards with embedded electronics used for variety of purposes. This particular company called Visteon Pvt Ltd, uses this technology to produce PCB for automobiles.We have developed a holistic view of the entire process using IoT and Raspberry Pi.

The process had 3 different problems to address:

PROBLEM 1 : Each board takes a certain amount of time to complete if that board hasn't been stopped for re-work.There was a need to
            create an automatic logging system, denoting the time. If it underwent any re-work, it'd have a separate time and those       
            alone would be logged.The normal one need not be logged.
            
PROBLEM 2 : During the process, one of the earliest stages involves smearing the board with solder paste to embed the electonic
            parts. The paste comes from a tube and there's no indication to give if there's paste left or not.We've also provided
            solution for it.
            
PROBLEM 3 : Final problem is to provide an indication for the proper working of the exhaust fans present in the SMT line, which 
            dries the solder paste.
